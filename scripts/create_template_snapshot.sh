# This script allows the administrator to create a new snapshot of the template server.
# The administrator can add new software or update dependencies on the template server, and then test it directly.
# Once the template server is ready, this script will create a new snapshot of it, that can be used to create temporary servers for the next jobs.
# The previous snapshot will be kept, the new one will be used by default. Any other snapshot will be deleted.
