# This script will be sent to the new host and will be executed there
# For this script to work, we assume three things:
# - the system is Debian-based (it was tested on Ubuntu 22.04)
# - the system is up-to-date, especially the kernel (otherwise, apt install may require user input)
# - the user uses a certificate without password for authentication, so using sudo works without password
