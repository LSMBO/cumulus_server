# This script will be sent to the new host and will be executed there
# For this script to work, we assume three things:
# - the system is Debian-based (it was tested on Ubuntu 22.04)
# - the system is up-to-date, especially the kernel (otherwise, apt install may require user input)
# - the user uses a certificate without password for authentication, so using sudo works without password

#IMPORTANT: this script has NOT been tested yet, consider it more like a guide to install a Cumulus server

# arguments (TODO put all the arguments in a config file?)
openstack_config_file=$1 # Path for the openstack configuration file, ie. /home/user/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml
network_ip_range=$2 # IP range for the NFS share, ie. 172.16.0/24 or *
data_volume_size_gb=$3 # Size of the data volume in GB, ie. 10000
template_flavor=$4 # Flavor for the template server, ie. m1.large
template_image=$5 # Image for the template server, ie. ubuntu-22.04
template_volume_size_gb=$6 # Size of the template volume in GB, ie. 100 (there should be enough space for the OS, the apps, docker images, etc.)
