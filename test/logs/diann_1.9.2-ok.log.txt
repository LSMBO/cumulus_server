DIA-NN 1.9.2 (Data-Independent Acquisition by Neural Networks)
Compiled on Oct 20 2024 02:59:53
Current date and time: Wed Jan 22 07:29:06 2025
Logical CPU cores: 64
Thread number set to 63
Output will be filtered at 0.01 FDR
Precursor/protein x samples expression level matrices will be saved along with the main report
Cysteine carbamidomethylation enabled as a fixed modification
Maximum number of variable modifications set to 3
Modification UniMod:35 with mass delta 15.9949 at M will be considered as variable
Modification UniMod:1 with mass delta 42.0106 at *n will be considered as variable
Scan window radius set to 10
A spectral library will be created from the DIA runs and used to reanalyse them; .quant files will only be saved to disk during the first step
When generating a spectral library, in silico predicted spectra will be retained if deemed more reliable than experimental ones
Implicit protein grouping: protein names; this determines which peptides are considered 'proteotypic' and thus affects protein FDR calculation
Normalisation disabled
Mass accuracy will be fixed to 1e-05 (MS2) and 1e-05 (MS1)
WARNING: protein inference is enabled but no FASTA provided - is this intended?
WARNING: peptidoform scoring enabled because variable modifications have been declared; to disable, use --no-peptidoforms
The following variable modifications will be scored: UniMod:35 UniMod:1 
Unless the spectral library specified was created by this version of DIA-NN, it's strongly recommended to specify a FASTA database and use the 'Reannotate' function to allow DIA-NN to identify peptides which can originate from the N/C terminus of the protein: otherwise site localisation might not work properly for modifications of the protein N-terminus or for modifications which do not allow enzymatic cleavage after the modified residue
