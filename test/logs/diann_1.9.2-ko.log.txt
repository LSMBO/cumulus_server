Thread number set to 4
Output will be filtered at 0.01 FDR
Precursor/protein x samples expression level matrices will be saved along with the main report
Cysteine carbamidomethylation enabled as a fixed modification
Maximum number of variable modifications set to 1
Modification UniMod:35 with mass delta 15.9949 at M will be considered as variable
Modification UniMod:1 with mass delta 42.0106 at *n will be considered as variable
Modification UniMod:21 with mass delta 79.9663 at STY will be considered as variable
Modification UniMod:121 with mass delta 114.043 at K will be considered as variable
Scan window radius set to 10
Peptidoform scoring enabled
A spectral library will be created from the DIA runs and used to reanalyse them; .quant files will only be saved to disk during the first step
Heuristic protein grouping will be used, to reduce the number of protein groups obtained; this mode is recommended for benchmarking protein ID numbers, GO/pathway and system-scale analyses
The spectral library (if generated) will retain the original spectra but will include empirically-aligned RTs
Mass accuracy will be fixed to 1e-05 (MS2) and 1e-05 (MS1)
WARNING: protein inference is enabled but no FASTA provided - is this intended?
The following variable modifications will be scored: UniMod:35 UniMod:1 UniMod:21 UniMod:121 
Unless the spectral library specified was created by this version of DIA-NN, it's strongly recommended to specify a FASTA database and use the 'Reannotate' function to allow DIA-NN to identify peptides which can originate from the N/C terminus of the protein: otherwise site localisation might not work properly for modifications of the protein N-terminus or for modifications which do not allow enzymatic cleavage after the modified residue
DIA-NN will discard peptides obtained using in silico cuts after the following modifications: UniMod:121,

Library contains q-values but there are no decoys included; if the library was generated with an old version of DIA-NN, this might lead to less reliable run-specific protein FDR when using it; ideally, the library needs to be generated using DIA-NN 1.9 or later
